🎓 Student Result Management System
📌 Project Description

The Student Result Management System is a Python-based application developed using Streamlit and SQLite.

The system allows administrators to manage student academic records efficiently. It performs automatic result calculations, assigns grades, stores data securely, and provides performance visualization.

This project demonstrates the implementation of advanced Python concepts including database management, authentication, data manipulation, and visualization.
